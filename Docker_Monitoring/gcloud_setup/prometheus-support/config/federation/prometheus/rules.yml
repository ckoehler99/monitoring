# M-Lab prometheus recording rules.
#
# Before adding a new recording rule, review the general documentation and best
# practices.
#
#  * https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/rules/
#  * https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/rules/
#
# NOTE: As of 2017-03, all rules are evalutated in parallel. Their evaluation
# order is not guaranteed, and dependencies between rules are not respected.
# Using recording rules on the right hand side of an expression can have
# undefined behavior and may result in recording old data or other errors.
#
#    https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/rules/manager.go#L240
#
# DO:
#  * Do use raw prometheus expressions on the right hand side of a new rule.
#
# DO NOT:
#  * Do not use recording rules on the right hand side of a new rule.
#  * Do not overwrite a metric name with itself.
#  * Do not use 'label_replace' to overwrite a metric name.
